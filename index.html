<div class="chiikawa"><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6670add926f2a64cd00fb0e7/7828ba38-8302-4215-b4e9-2873c2a27ecc/characters+chiikawa+phonetic+and+name+copy.png?format=750w">
 <p class="chiikawa-para">Chiikawa is gentle, sweet, and kind. Cautious to step out of their comfort zone, and somewhat shy, Chiikawa often gets nervous which usually results in anxious tears. Thankfully, best friends Hachiware and Usagi always has this cute and small creature’s back. Chiikawa lives in a fantasy world filled with some similarities to ours. Inhabitants love food, they exercise, and they go to work and earn money to buy things just like we do. Everyone in Chiikawa’s world works for a living. Knights dressed in armor assign duties including the popular job of weeding. When you pass the weeding exam, you can earn more money and buy more things. Another popular job is hunting, because monsters sometimes mysteriously appear and need to be banished before they can wreak havoc. Chiikawa’s closest friends are Hachiware and Usagi. Together, Chiikawa, Hachiware, and Usagi have good days and bad days, just like us. They laugh, they cry, they dance. As caring best friends, they lift each other up. And they always try to find the fun in any situation. Chiikawa comes from the Japanese phrase "Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu" meaning “something small and cute”.  Chiisai means small, and kawaii means cute. Put them together and you get Chiikawa!  </p></div>
